Please note, original hypoML app was built by Qianwen Wang: https://bitbucket.org/hypoML/hypoml.bitbucket.io/src/master/

These files are what I have added/ modified in order to provide additional functionality.
They provide a 'Compare' view at the bottom of the app that allows up to 3 concepts to be examined simultaneously.

To add, add the components in the Components folder here to hypoML's client/src/Components folder. 
Update const, helper and add CompPainter to src directory.
